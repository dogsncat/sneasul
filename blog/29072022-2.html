        <p>29th july 2022 (2) - Unfinished, old, and traditional art dump</p>
        <article class="mt-2">
            <p class="mt-3">
                This is an art dump of all of the old/alt pieces of art I have on my hard drives. Some of this is stuff I think is good—and I'll comment a bit on pieces I think were interesting to me as I was looking through them—while others are still quite embarrasing to share, but nonetheless they're here on this page!
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope you enjoy looking at some of these. I've always enjoyed artists releasing their scraps, so hopefully you find this interesting too!
                <br>
                <br>
                Oh and also, they're not in any chronological order or anything. I'm not sure I have exact enough dates to do that. They're in order of how interesting/good they are (in my opinion).

                I'm actually very proud of this one - it was done it Photoshop on a whim when my friend was encouraging me to make more art. A period in my life when I was completely burned out by an art course I did. 2018 probably.

                These were done in a software called Rebelle 4. Very powerful simulation software for stuff like realistic watercolours, oil paint, and other mediums. I could never get it to look as good as the real stuff haha, but if you are a much better artist than I am then you'd be able to get some killer stuff out of it.
